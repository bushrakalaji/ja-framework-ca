# eCommy Store

This is an eCom Store built with React, showcasing a wide range of products available for purchase. Users can browse the products, view individual product details, add items to their cart, and proceed to the checkout process.

## Demo

## Features

The eCom Store offers the following features across its pages:

1. **Homepage**: The homepage displays a list of products available for purchase. Users can easily browse through the product catalog and explore different items.

2. **Individual Product Page**: Each product has its own dedicated page that provides detailed information about the item. Users can view the product's title, description, pricing, and any available discounts. They can also see product images and customer reviews, if available. An "Add to Cart" button allows users to add the product to their cart.

3. **Cart Page**: The cart page allows users to review the items they have added for purchase. It provides a summary of the selected products, including titles, prices, quantities, and a total amount. Users can modify the quantities or remove products from the cart if needed.

4. **Checkout Success Page**: After successfully completing the checkout process, users are redirected to the checkout success page. This page confirms the order and displays a success message. Users can find relevant order details and a summary of the purchased products.
